      consent.

AB  - Clinical trial consent for protocols and their revisions should be transparent
      for patients and traceable for stakeholders. Our goal is to implement a process
      allowing for collection of patients' informed consent, which is bound to protocol
      revisions, storing and tracking the consent in a secure, unfalsifiable and
      publicly verifiable way, and enabling the sharing of this information in real
      time. For that, we build a consent workflow using a trending technology called
      Blockchain. This is a distributed technology that brings a built-in layer of
      transparency and traceability. From a more general and prospective point of view,
      we believe Blockchain technology brings a paradigmatical shift to the entire
      clinical research field. We designed a Proof-of-Concept protocol consisting of
      time-stamping each step of the patient's consent collection using Blockchain,
      thus archiving and historicising the consent through cryptographic validation in 
      a securely unfalsifiable and transparent way. For each protocol revision, consent
      was sought again. We obtained a single document, in an open format, that
      accounted for the whole consent collection process: a time-stamped consent status
      regarding each version of the protocol. This document cannot be corrupted and can
      be checked on any dedicated public website. It should be considered a robust
      proof of data. However, in a live clinical trial, the authentication system
      should be strengthened to remove the need for third parties, here trial
      stakeholders, and give participative control to the peer users. In the future,
      the complex data flow of a clinical trial could be tracked by using Blockchain,
      which core functionality, named Smart Contract, could help prevent clinical trial
      events not occurring in the correct chronological order, for example including
      patients before they consented or analysing case report form data before freezing
      the database. Globally, Blockchain could help with reliability, security,
      transparency and could be a consistent step toward reproducibility.
