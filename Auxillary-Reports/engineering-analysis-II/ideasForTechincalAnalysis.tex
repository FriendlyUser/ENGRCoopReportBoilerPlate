% Advantages of Decentralized table and graphs
% Created table comparing supercomputer to specs of good linux machine, assume that 50% of processing power is used for blockchain,
% storage, energy consumption, processing power, maintenance costs, also create graph showing how a centralized system can be faster than decentrailized if no one supports the support (no peers on torrent)

% One graph on energy consumption of power of stake, power of work, bitcoin and etheruem compared to countries

% One pie graph showing causes of IT failures

% Estimated cost of transactions for smart contracts compared to buying houses manually, transferring money (cryptocurrencies), supply chains (how frequency does transactions get lost and miscalculated)
