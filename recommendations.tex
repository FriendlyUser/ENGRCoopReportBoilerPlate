 \section{Recommendations}
 
 
  
Continued research into \gls{blockchain} technologies is necessary as innovations such as \gls{side chains}, permissioned blockchains such as \gls{HyperLedger Composer}, widespread adoption of cryptocurrency and technologies evolutions address the shortcomings of blockchain. In trustless systems tampering or modification of transactional history is extremely difficult. This suggests that smart contracts can greatly improve transactions, however, issues including scalability, reversing fraudulent activity and reduction of contract deployment hinder mass adoption.

All computer programs have bugs, by limiting complexity of smart contracts,  using reliable standards highly audited packages, and using software security analyze tools risk can be greatly reduced. Continuing to monitor technology innovations such ever-increasing computational power is important to ensure cracking private keys remain uneconomical see Figure \ref{security:fig2}. 

Provided a deterministic set of inputs and outputs, with computational verifiable conditions, using smart contracts is beneficial.
Increasing awareness about \gls{blockchain} technologies, so that the average person understands the limitations of smart contracts and suitable applications is a key aspect in increasing adoption and widespread acceptance of \gls{blockchain} technologies.
