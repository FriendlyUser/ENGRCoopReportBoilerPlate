\newglossaryentry{Bitcoin}
{
	name={Bitcoin},
	description ={
		a type of digital currency in which encryption techniques are used to regulate the generation of units of currency and verify the transfer of funds, operating independently of a central bank
	}
}
%%% Add in Solidity is a programming language specified designed for smart contracts. It takes inspiration from javascript, python and C++. 
\newglossaryentry{blockchain}
{
	name={blockchain},
	description ={
		A blockchain is a digitized, decentralized, public ledger of all cryptocurrency transactions.  It constantly grows as the most recent transactions (blocks) are appended in chronlogical order.
		%Constantly growing as \textit{completed} blocks (the most recent transactions) are recorded and added to it in chronological order, it allows market participants to keep track of digital currency transactions without central recordkeeping.
	}
}


\newglossaryentry{DApp}
{
	name={Dapp},
	description ={
		Decentralized Application have backend code running on a decentralized peer-to-peer network and not controlled by a single entity. In a decentralized application transactions are versified through consensus of multiple users.
	},
	first={Decentralized Application(DApp)}

\newglossaryentry{Ethereum}
{
	name={Ethereum},
	description={
		an open software platform based on blockchain technology that enables developers to build and deploy decentralized applications. The main unit of currency is ether. The most popular block explorer, etherscan is useful for analyzing transactions and viewing general Ethereum statistics.
	}
}

\newglossaryentry{HyperLedger}
{
	name={HyperLedger},
	description ={
		group of open-source blockchain technologies started by the Linux Foundation
	}
}

\newglossaryentry{HyperLedger Composer}
{
	name={HyperLedger Composer},
	description ={
		permissioned blockchain that defines assets, business rules, and participants, and access controls for existing roles and types of transactions.
	}
}

\newglossaryentry{MetaMask}
{
	name={MetaMask},
	description ={
		is a browser plugin that allows users to make Ethereum transactions through regular websites
	}
}



\newglossaryentry{smart contract}
{
	name={smart contract},
	description ={
		computer program that directly controls transfer of digital currencies or assets under predefined conditions and used to automatic transactions on the blockchain. These transactions are trackable and irreservable.
	}
}

\newglossaryentry{side chains}
{
	name={side chains},
	description= {
	are emerging mechanisms enable secure transfer of digital assets and tokens between blockchains. Attached to the parent blockchain using a two-way peg, sidechains are a separate blockchain and enables interchangeability of assets at a predetermined rate \cite{sideChains:Online}. 
	}
}
%% Software Tools
\newglossaryentry{git}
{
	name={git},
	description ={
			the most popular version control system used for tracking changes in source code and coordinating work on those files among multiple people.
	}
}


\newglossaryentry{GitLab}
{
	name={GitLab},
	description ={
		GitLab is an online Git repository manager with a wiki, issue tracking, and used to manage \gls{git} repositories on a centralized server
	}
}

\newglossaryentry{SHA-256}
{
	name={SHA-256},
	description ={
		cryptographic hash function that takes an input of a random size and produces an output of a fixed size. Hash functions are powerful because they are \textit{one-way}. What this is means is, it is possible for anyone to use a hash function to produce an output when given an input. However, it is impossible to use the output of the hash function to reconstruct its given input.
	},
	first={Secure Hash Algorithm-256}
}


\newglossaryentry{NFT}
{
	name={NFT},
	description ={
		is a special type of cryptographic token which represents something unique; non-fungible tokens are thus not interchangeable. This is different than most tokens such as ERC20. Used to represent unique assets, such as houses and cryptokitties.
	},
	first={Non-fungible token (NFT)}
}

\newglossaryentry{gas}
{
	name={gas},
	description={
	In Solidity, your users have to pay every time they execute a function on your DApp using a currency called gas. Users buy gas with Ether (the currency on Ethereum), so your users have to spend ETH in order to execute functions on your DApp. \\ \\ How much gas is required to execute a function depends on how complex that function's logic is. Each individual operation has a gas cost based roughly on how much computing resources will be required to perform that operation (e.g. writing to storage is much more expensive than adding two integers). The total gas cost of your function is the sum of the gas costs of all its individual operations.
