#### Uvic Latex Co-op Report

This is the boilerplate I used for my third co-op report at the University of Victoria. An sample can be viewed at https://www.overleaf.com/read/mnrhvvxjwvdj and in the future on my personal website. Any changes are welcome.

##### Getting started

To get started clone or download this repo, and update/replace my summary in reportContent.tex, as well as the letter of transmittal. Manually modify the word front page template (WTR Title Page Template.docx), and then save to pdf and include using includepdf.

Glossary entries can be added in glossaries.tex and the bibliography is in bibliography.tex.

Additional, the sections specified in the UVIC co-op report template are in `introduction.tex`, `discussion.tex`, `conclusions.tex` and `reccomendations.tex`.
