 In the continuing effort to organize high-quality reliable information, the \gls{MOTI} \gls{IMB} is presently experimenting with \gls{JIRA}, an \gls{issue} tracking tool and \gls{Confluence}, \gls{wiki} software for technical documentation. Although good quality information is critical to operations, \gls{sd} is inconsistent and scattered across multiple sources, some of which require access permissions.\gls{JIRA} and Confluence are software tools that improve productivity and organization within MOTI IMB. \\ \\
 Benefits from connecting \gls{JIRA} and \gls{Confluence} include common user management, reporting on existing JIRA \glspl{issue} in \gls{Confluence} and switching between application quickly. Extending the functionality of these tools by installing add-ons will assist in improving \gls{sd}. Purchasing software such as \gls{Confluence} to solve the \gls{sd} problem is inadequate because software can be poorly designed or implemented. These software tools assist in information management, but full utilization and proper implementation is required to improve documentation.
