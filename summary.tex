  The rise of centralized music streaming platforms has significantly reduced artist compensation because incentives to pay music labels first, unclear payment structures, and a lack of transparency. Another way to compensate artists is to issue digital tokens, which are spendable on accommodations, recording time and studio time. In order to empower artists and avoid pitfalls of streaming services, ownership and control of digital token must be decentralized. %however, implementation of a decentralized application can increase tra
   
   Although \gls{blockchain} is the technology that is associated with the cryptocurrency, Bitcoin, the use cases of blockchain are numerous including building decentralized applications. Ensuring that digital assets can be redeemed requires the usage of \glspl{smart contract} to automatically execute transactions. Additionally, ensuring ownership of tokens and safe transfers of digital assets are essential.
   
   Visually representation of rewards can be implemented using an image, hosted of decentralized storage such as IPFS, or contain a form of "dna" that maps to specific components.

 %In the continuing effort to organize high-quality reliable information, the %\gls{MOTI} \gls{IMB} is presently experimenting with \gls{JIRA}, an \gls{issue} tracking tool and \gls{Confluence}, \gls{wiki} software for technical documentation. Although good quality information is critical to operations, \gls{sd} is inconsistent and scattered across multiple sources, some of which require access permissions.\gls{JIRA} and Confluence are software tools that improve productivity and organization within MOTI IMB. \\ \\
 %Benefits from connecting \gls{JIRA} and \gls{Confluence} include common user management, reporting on existing JIRA \glspl{issue} in \gls{Confluence} and switching between application quickly. Extending the functionality of these tools by installing add-ons will assist in improving \gls{sd}. Purchasing software such as \gls{Confluence} to solve the \gls{sd} problem is inadequate because software can be poorly designed or implemented. These software tools assist in information management, but full utilization and proper implementation is required to improve documentation.
