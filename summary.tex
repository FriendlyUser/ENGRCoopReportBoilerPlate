  Growing usage on digital services and interconnectivity have revolutionized modern society and simplified purchase goods, but created a centralized web ecosystem.
  % Something about blockchain
  Web 3.0, or the decentralized web built on blockchain technologies allow connectivity and transactions between peers instead of trusting large centralized companies. 
  The major types of blockchains are public, permissioned and private with varying amount of access. In addition, smart contracts are self executing code that directly controls transfer of assets under predefined conditions. 
  
  With access to significantly public resources, a open-source base, a public blockchain provides high processing speeds and support for smart contracts. Furthermore, smart contracts can be used to streamline and eliminate middlemen in transactions.
  Regulatory uncertainly, lack of legal acceptance for smart contracts and scaling issues with blockchain hinder adoption. Despite advantages of smart contracts to simplify transactions, writing bug-free code is virtual impossible and following best practices is essential to limit risk.  Overall, for certain transactions with clearly defined conditions, smart contracts can greatly reduce cost while increasing transparency.
  
  
% In the continuing effort to organize high-quality reliable information, the \gls{MOTI} \gls{IMB} is presently experimenting with \gls{JIRA}, an \gls{issue} tracking tool and \gls{Confluence}, \gls{wiki} software for technical documentation. Although good quality information is critical to operations, \gls{sd} is inconsistent and scattered across multiple sources, some of which require access permissions.\gls{JIRA} and Confluence are software tools that improve productivity and organization within MOTI IMB. \\ \\
% Benefits from connecting \gls{JIRA} and \gls{Confluence} include common user management, reporting on existing JIRA \glspl{issue} in \gls{Confluence} and switching between application quickly. Extending the functionality of these tools by installing add-ons will assist in improving \gls{sd}. Purchasing software such as \gls{Confluence} to solve the \gls{sd} problem is inadequate because software can be poorly designed or implemented. These software tools assist in information management, but full utilization and proper implementation is required to improve documentation.
