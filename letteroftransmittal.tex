 Dear Susan, 
 
 Please accept the accompanying Work Term Report entitled "Determining uses of JIRA and Confluence at OFI IBM."
 
 This report is the result of work completed at the SOME GENEriC ORGANIZATION. During my first work 
 term as a University of Victoria student, I used charts and tables to display information about issue, complied documentation for critical applications in a wiki and researched add-ons to extend functionality. In the course of work, I gained exposure to a technical environment, and learned how software can integrate together. 
 
 Through the course of the term, I was given the opportunity to learn much agile software development, testing applications, and software products. I feel that this knowledge will be helpful in future work terms, and in my career.
 
 I would like to thank my manager, MISTER MAN, for his patience and good judgement, as well as
 the RANDOM FOLK who were always willing to help.
 Sincerely,

 David Li
