 Dear Duncan, 
 
 Please accept the accompanying Work Term Report entitled "Creating a proof of concept decentralized marketplace on Ethereum."
 
 This report is the result of work completed at Membran Entertainment Canada.
 Leveraging my existing knowledge of blockchain concepts with my interest in programming, I learned how to build decentralized applications using frameworks such as truffle, deploy to testnets such as ropsten and use reactive stores such as Drizzle to manage contract state.
  
 This report is the result of interest and exposure to blockchain development and technologies as part of my third co-op work term. Using the most popular smart contract programming language, Solidity, I created logic for a decentralized application. Some issues of implementing and determinating the viability of smart contracts to simplify transactions include regulation, conflict resolvement and ability to reverse fraduent transactions. Technological advances including exponential increases in computational power that render modern cryptographical useless are not explored. Some problems faced in this report include rapid changes in technology, constantly changing standards, and legal uncertainty surrounding blockchain.
  
 I would like to thank my manager, Dino Coletti, for his patience and good judgement, as well as
 the my coworkers who were always willing to help.
 Sincerely,

 David Li
