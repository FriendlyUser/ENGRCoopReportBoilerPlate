year="2017",
month="Aug",

volume="41",
number="8",
pages="497--500",
abstract="This paper discusses the life cycle of decentralized smart contracts, i.e. digital and executable representations of rights and obligations in a multi-party environment. The life cycle relies on blockchain technology, i.e. a distributed digital ledger, to ensure proper implementation and integrity of the smart contracts. The life cycle consists of four subsequent phases: Creation, freezing, execution, and finalization. For each phase actors and technological services are identified and explained in detail. With the life cycle at hand, risks and limitations of smart contracts and the underlying blockchain technology are briefly discussed.",

title="Analysis of Blockchain technology: pros, cons and SWOT",
journal="Cluster Computing",
year="2018",
month="Mar",
day="19",
abstract="Any online transaction that involves digital money is a bit of a challenge these days with the rising threats of hackers trying to steal bank details posted online. This leads to the invention of various kinds of crypto-currency, Bitcoin being one of them. The technology behind using the Bitcoin is popularly called as Blockchain. Blockchain is a digitized, de-centralized, public ledger of all crypto-currency transaction/s. Blockchain tries to create and share all the online transactions, stored in a distributed ledger, as a data structure on a network of computers. It validates the transactions using peer-to-peer network of computers. It allows users to make and verify transactions immediately without a central authority. Blockchain is a transaction database which contains information about all the transactions ever executed in the past and works on Bitcoin protocol. In this analysis paper we discussed what is Blockchain?, SWOT analysis of BC, Types of BC and how Blockchain works along with its advantages and disadvantages.",

title="On legal contracts, imperative and declarative smart contracts, and blockchain systems",
journal="Artificial Intelligence and Law",
year="2018",
month="Mar",
day="05",
abstract="This paper provides an analysis of how concepts pertinent to legal contracts can influence certain aspects of their digital implementation through smart contracts, as inspired by recent developments in distributed ledger technology. We discuss how properties of imperative and declarative languages including the underlying architectures to support contract management and lifecycle apply to various aspects of legal contracts. We then address these properties in the context of several blockchain architectures. While imperative languages are commonly used to implement smart contracts, we find that declarative languages provide more natural ways to deal with certain aspects of legal contracts and their automated management.",
