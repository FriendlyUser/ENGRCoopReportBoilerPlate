Atlassian, an enterprise software company, produces software tools including \gls{JIRA} and Confluence for team collaboration, software development and organization. At MOTI IMB, enterprise software is used for issue tracking, project management and organize content. Currently, information is scattered across LAN DRIVES, \gls{sharepoint} Sites and other sources that work for small groups of people. Going forward, using enterprise software such as JIRA and Confluence is essential to manage projects and their issues throughout the software development lifecycle.

Inspecting the capabilities of JIRA and Confluence is helpful to streamlining the adoption of these versatile software products. While JIRA offers flexible issue tracking and project management, Confluence is wiki software used for technical documentation that locates information quickly and easily. Improving and standardizing documentation for applications requires methodically examining software capabilities. Criteria include functionality, compatibility, ease of use, strategic purpose and integration with existing software. Switching to JIRA has reduced email volume, improved customer support and simplified project management. Currently, the use Confluence restricted to selected individuals. Analysing the potential uses of Confluence and JIRA will provide insight on how to better use these new tools.
